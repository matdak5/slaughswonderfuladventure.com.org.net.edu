        <p> pt4, (5 years later in a land far away) big lion was running gracefully through the pasture of paastureness. little did lord almighty big lion man man know, that takashi 6IX7EVEN was waiting in the darkness of a corner to snitch on big lion almighty man man like he did on 22 snavage. the police came because of takashi 6IX7EVEN and threw oh lord almighty big lion man man into a cave in the middle of las vegas and sealed the entrance, but little did lord allmighty big lion man man know what was waiting in the shadows in the far side of the cave that was in las vegas in 1357, or rather who? (Commercial Break) (WE back), it was little tyler woman child hiding in the corner in the far side of the cave that was in las vegas in 1357. Tyler had survived the ebola outbreak in 2000000BC and has been hiding in this cave ever since the battle of gettysburg. Tyler wanted to help big lion after touching big lion (not sexually). Tyler had the powers of a sexy opra singer, and he started to sing in the far isde of the cave that was in las vegas in 1357. Tyler broke the seal on the cave with his very sexy voice, and held his mighty rubber duck, as he rode on big lions back into the sunset. They some up of the all mighty scary men of lil ppump 6 year old fans, they were 2 powerful. tyler held his mighty rubber duck and destroted the lil pump 6 year old fans, the duck saved the day (he pooped on all them) They rode off into the sunset and rode into The Galopagos Islands and saw a penquin, They lived happily ever
